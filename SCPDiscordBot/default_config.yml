# Set permissions for discord roles here.
# The permissions are sorted by discord role ids, and the permissions are regex patterns.
# One of the regex patterns associated with one of your roles must match the command you are using for it to be allowed.
# For instance, if you want to allow someone to use the command "test" but not the command "test test" you can use the permission "test$". The "$" signifies the point where the string ends in regex.
